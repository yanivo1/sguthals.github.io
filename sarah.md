# Sarah Guthals, PhD

I’m from San Diego, born, raised, and still live here. I went to UC San Diego where I earned a BS, MS, and PhD in Computer Science with an emphasis on education. My dissertation was “Designing Learning Experiences that Enculturate Novices”, which focused on computer science education for novices of every age; from K-12, to university, to full-time teachers who were asked to learn computer science so they could teach AP CS the following year. 

During grad school I started a company focused on teaching kids how to code through in person and online courses and self-guided software. For this work and my PhD work I was awarded Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in the Science category in 2016. I’ve written nearly a dozen technical books as part of the For Dummies series, for both kids and adults (most recent one comes out this summer; “GitHub For Dummies”). I worked as a contractor for GitHub for a year and a half prototyping and testing an under-13-year-old version of GitHub. For the last year and a half, I was an engineering manager at GitHub for the editor tools team, which builds GitHub integrations into Visual Studio, VS Code, Atom, and Unity. I also occasionally lecture at UCSD in the Computer Science and Education departments and I have a small startup where I mostly do consulting in computer science education. 

I'm currently a Sr Program Manager at Microsoft in the Academic Ecosystems team where my focus is to help K-12 students and lifelong learners learn and use Azure to meet their personal and professional goals. I work remotely from San Diego with my husband, one year old daughter, puppy, and two cats.
